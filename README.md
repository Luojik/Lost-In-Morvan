After the British Empire's withdrawal from India, William Fletcher, a seasoned officer, feels lost. Recalled to England after years of service in the colonies, William boards a ship that lands him in Marseille, Franceâ€”a country he has never visited.

His journey from Marseille to London seems straightforward: Marseille to Lyon, Lyon to Paris, and then on to Calais for the crossing to England. But fate has other plans. As he travels through the French countryside, his car crashes deep in the woods, leaving him injured and stranded where both the landscape and language are foreign to him.
